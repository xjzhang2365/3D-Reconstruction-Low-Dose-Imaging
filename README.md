# Low-Dose Image Reconstruction Framework

Computational methods for extracting diagnostic information from dose-limited imaging data. Originally developed for electron microscopy, these techniques address fundamental challenges in medical imaging where radiation dose must be minimized for patient safety.

## Medical Imaging Applications
- **Low-dose CT**: Reduce radiation while maintaining diagnostic quality
- **Digital Mammography**: Optimize dose in breast cancer screening
- **Tomosynthesis**: 3D reconstruction from limited projections
- **Real-time Imaging**: Denoise for interventional procedures

## Methods
- Advanced denoising (BM3D, dictionary learning)
- Physics-based reconstruction with constraints
- Bayesian parameter estimation
